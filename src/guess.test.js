//Other tests
//If letter is not within the word. After the guess the corresponding button does not have functionality.
//All buttons are functional(letter,backspace,enter)
//Enter will only work if there are 5 letters that have been entered
//Backspace will only will if there is >0 letters entered
//Will not add a letter if word.length is 5 letters long
